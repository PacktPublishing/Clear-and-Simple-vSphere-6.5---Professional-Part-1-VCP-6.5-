WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:06.030
In this video I'll demonstrate how to configure roles and permissions and the Beast for web client.

00:06.030 --> 00:12.720
So here you can see I've already logged into my vse fear web client and at the home screen we have the

00:12.720 --> 00:15.010
roles button right here.

00:15.180 --> 00:21.150
You can also access roles by going to the administration area and we can see all of our roles right

00:21.150 --> 00:22.180
here.

00:22.350 --> 00:26.550
And so underneath roles we've got a few things that we need to be aware of.

00:26.550 --> 00:30.640
Now number one you've got the built in Administrator role.

00:30.870 --> 00:37.330
And if we take a look at the privileges included there you can see it's pretty much everything right.

00:37.350 --> 00:45.750
The administrator can do everything whereas the other built in roles like Read-Only and no access are

00:45.750 --> 00:48.260
substantially more restrictive.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.090
And those three are pretty self-explanatory.

00:51.110 --> 00:59.130
Right we've got our administrator our Read-Only and our no access you can also see here.

00:59.460 --> 01:07.650
There is another pre-built standard role that's included automatically called No cryptography administrator

01:08.520 --> 01:16.710
and this is essentially the same privileges as the administrator role with a couple minor differences.

01:16.740 --> 01:21.860
The most significant of which being it can't do encryption operations.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.210
So with these for a 6.5 we can encrypt virtual machine disks.

01:26.370 --> 01:28.400
We can't do that if we've got no.

01:28.410 --> 01:31.470
Cryptography administrator Rob.

01:31.600 --> 01:37.000
So that's an administrator that can do everything except for cryptographic operations.

01:39.370 --> 01:44.350
So those are the kind of big for pre-built roles right there.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.700
We've also got a bunch of sample rolls.

01:47.740 --> 01:55.280
So if you need to create your own custom roles you can actually do so based on these samples.

01:55.540 --> 01:58.040
And that's a great way to create a new custom role.

01:58.060 --> 02:04.360
So if I wanted to create a new custom role similar to the content library administrator sample role

02:04.750 --> 02:13.990
I could simply hit clone I could create my own custom roll and I can choose exactly which privileges

02:14.050 --> 02:15.400
should be included.

02:17.220 --> 02:22.560
And as you can see here I've already created a couple of sample custom roles I'm actually going to get

02:22.560 --> 02:30.050
rid of these and we're going to create a new custom moral.

02:30.200 --> 02:38.260
So I'm going to call my new custom roll help desk and this is a custom role for my helpdesk team.

02:38.380 --> 02:42.390
So I want them to be able to do things like manage alarms.

02:42.430 --> 02:48.680
I want them to be able to do things like open a console to a virtual machine.

02:48.820 --> 02:56.200
And so under virtual machine I'll give them certain permissions like interaction and configuration and

02:56.200 --> 03:02.830
guest operations and I'll choose some other things that I want to allow my helpdesk team to do like

03:02.830 --> 03:08.760
maybe for example place a host in a maintenance mode or something like that.

03:09.030 --> 03:15.160
Anyways I'll just kind of pick and choose exactly what I want to allow my helpdesk administrators to

03:15.160 --> 03:15.970
do.

03:16.240 --> 03:20.770
And those are the privileges that will be included in this role.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.220
So that's what our role is.

03:22.270 --> 03:26.030
It's simply a set of privileges.

03:26.150 --> 03:33.680
And so now I've created my own custom role for my helpdesk team with a specific set of privileges included

03:33.680 --> 03:34.260
there.

03:34.550 --> 03:39.010
And so this role in and of itself doesn't actually accomplish anything.

03:39.050 --> 03:44.540
The role doesn't mean anything until I actually assign it to a user.

03:44.540 --> 03:51.530
So let's go here to hosts and Klosters and I'm going to set up a new permission by the way a quick side

03:51.530 --> 03:51.780
note.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.410
You may notice that my hosts are disconnected here.

03:55.430 --> 04:01.420
That was because I had expired licenses which I have since resolved.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.990
So when your license expires it disconnects your hosts.

04:05.060 --> 04:08.780
I have figured out the licensing issues though.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.730
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to reconnect these hosts quickly here.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.770
That my license is up to date they should connect no problem.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.910
Anyways let's go ahead and set up some permissions.

04:20.910 --> 04:28.410
So here you can see I've clicked on my H.A. cluster and under the H.A. cluster I'm going to go to permissions

04:28.500 --> 04:30.540
by the way my hosts are connected now.

04:31.110 --> 04:35.980
So I'm going to go to permissions and I'm going to create a new permission.

04:36.300 --> 04:43.790
So let's click a little plus button here and what I want to do is I want to give the help desk roll

04:46.480 --> 04:49.690
to either a user or group.

04:49.870 --> 04:54.070
So if I click on Add here I'm going to be able to see all of my users and groups in the vees for that

04:54.160 --> 04:56.740
local domain in your environment.

04:56.740 --> 05:02.620
You've probably got an active directory domain available here and you can pick active directory domain

05:02.620 --> 05:04.100
users and groups.

05:04.420 --> 05:09.460
So I'm just going to pick a random group here I'm going to call it ESX adman's.

05:09.490 --> 05:10.460
Perfect.

05:10.490 --> 05:11.810
I'll add here.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.020
OK.

05:15.190 --> 05:23.770
So what I've established so far is everybody in this particular group ESX adman's is going to get the

05:23.770 --> 05:25.160
help desk role.

05:25.460 --> 05:31.000
They're going to get the help desk roll on the H.A. cluster.

05:31.180 --> 05:34.940
So they're going to have all of these privileges on that ha cluster.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.970
And I've got this propagate to children box checked.

05:39.970 --> 05:47.880
So that means that child objects of that cluster such as these two ESX hosts here are also going to

05:47.880 --> 05:49.980
get this same permission.

05:50.010 --> 05:58.010
So when I hit OK here the permissions should appear and there it is ESX admins have the help desk.

05:58.170 --> 06:04.080
And if I drill down and look at these child objects and look at their permissions they should have that

06:04.080 --> 06:05.200
permission as well.

06:06.130 --> 06:10.610
Because I can figure that checkbox to propagate to child objects.

06:10.630 --> 06:17.560
If I look at my hosts if I look at my virtual machines that permission should have propagated down to

06:17.560 --> 06:23.330
all of these child objects and we can see that it has.

06:23.380 --> 06:27.910
So that's how you create roles and permissions inside of the Vees.

06:27.910 --> 06:28.890
Fair web client.

06:29.020 --> 06:35.870
And you just want to keep in mind the roles are simply a collection of privileges privileges.

06:36.130 --> 06:43.710
Define what we can do and those privileges are used to create a permission for either a user or a group.

00:00.660 --> 00:06.360
In this video I'll demonstrate how to secure vse fair virtual machines.

00:06.490 --> 00:12.100
So here you can see I'm at the homescreen of Vee's for a web client and we're going to start by looking

00:12.100 --> 00:13.850
at storage policies.

00:14.170 --> 00:20.170
And there's one specific storage policy that I'd like to show you the VM encryption policy.

00:20.620 --> 00:29.740
So this is a storage policy that allows us to dictate that the virtual disks for a virtual machine should

00:29.740 --> 00:31.140
be encrypted.

00:32.540 --> 00:39.450
And so that's how we're going to actually configure virtual machine disk encryption.

00:39.800 --> 00:45.260
And so prior to showing you the setting on the actual virtual machine itself I wanted to come in here

00:45.260 --> 00:52.130
quickly and show you the storage policy that dictates that a virtual machines disk should be encrypted

00:53.000 --> 01:00.410
and if we go back to our home screen and browse to hosts and Klosters Actually I'm going to grab a virtual

01:00.410 --> 01:05.990
machine right click it and go to edit settings

01:10.280 --> 01:15.570
and under edit settings I'm going to expand my hard disk for this VM.

01:15.920 --> 01:21.140
And here you can see the virtual machine storage policies and one of the storage policies that I can

01:21.140 --> 01:24.470
choose from is the VM encryption policy.

01:25.380 --> 01:32.670
So the reason that this is circled in red is because my VM configuration files are not encrypted and

01:32.670 --> 01:38.630
the hard disks can only be encrypted when the configuration files themselves are encrypted.

01:38.640 --> 01:44.520
So what I can do to resolve this is actually go to my VM click on it and I mean the hosts and cluster's

01:44.520 --> 01:53.010
view here and under configure I can go to policies and I can edit the V.M. storage policies not only

01:53.010 --> 01:57.220
for the virtual disk itself but for the virtual machine home directory.

01:57.600 --> 02:04.670
And that's what's going to include those configuration files that we saw before and that error message.

02:05.040 --> 02:12.090
So this is going to show us how we can actually apply encryption across not only the virtual disks but

02:12.180 --> 02:15.000
the VM home directory as well.

02:15.830 --> 02:23.270
And so this is a great security option that I can utilize just in case somebody were to somehow export

02:23.270 --> 02:28.840
a copy of this VMT K First some sort of nefarious purpose.

02:29.510 --> 02:33.330
Once they got that VMT OK all of the data on it would be encrypted.

02:33.530 --> 02:37.730
So this is definitely a great way to secure virtual machine data.

02:39.430 --> 02:44.920
Another feature that's supported in these first six top five is secure boot.

02:44.920 --> 02:51.730
So what secure boot does is it ensures that the software running on the virtual machine is actually

02:51.730 --> 02:52.550
legitimate.

02:52.570 --> 02:57.490
Like for example if you're running Windows on a virtual machine it validates that it's a legitimate

02:57.550 --> 03:05.300
installation of Windows so in order to enable secure buu on a virtual machine you'll simply right click

03:05.300 --> 03:15.330
that VM go to edit settings and look for Buddh options under VM options.

03:15.350 --> 03:21.560
So here is V.M. options Here's our boot options and here's where we could potentially enable secure

03:21.560 --> 03:23.210
buth as well.

03:23.210 --> 03:30.530
Now there are certain operating systems that support those like Windows or a nested ESX host.

03:30.530 --> 03:36.350
So you'll need to take a look at the documentation and ensure that what you're trying to enable this

03:36.350 --> 03:38.210
on is actually supported.

03:39.230 --> 03:45.890
And here you see the VM where documentation showing you all the information you need in order to enable

03:45.890 --> 03:54.210
U.A.E. ephi secure but so again like I said it's only supported by certain operating systems for Windows

03:54.390 --> 03:58.990
for ESX inside a virtual machine for Linux virtual machines.

03:59.070 --> 04:04.470
Some of the compatibility specifications are explained here.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.720
So these are some of the things that you might want to be aware of prior to enabling you with high secure

04:09.720 --> 04:10.390
but.

04:11.040 --> 04:16.140
And all of this information isn't available in the vse for documentation.

04:16.230 --> 04:23.830
Now another option that I want to look at under VM options is VM Ware tools installation.

04:23.940 --> 04:27.620
So here you can see the VMWare tools upgrades.

04:27.790 --> 04:34.080
I have a box checked that says the VM or tools should be automatically upgraded and checked every time

04:34.080 --> 04:35.910
this virtual machine powers on.

04:36.150 --> 04:43.110
This is going to ensure that this virtual machine is kept at the latest version of VM or tools and that

04:43.110 --> 04:48.890
I don't have to do a special reboot just to install the latest upgrades to VM more tools.

04:48.900 --> 04:55.740
Now one final thing I want to show you over here and VM options is the ability to configure encrypted

04:55.780 --> 04:56.850
Wii motion.

04:57.300 --> 05:05.010
So here under encryption I'm going to expand the encryption area and we have a couple of different options

05:05.010 --> 05:06.710
here for encrypted Wii motion.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.190
So the first option shown says opportunistic.

05:10.230 --> 05:13.940
And by the way there's a nice little information button here to the right.

05:13.950 --> 05:17.480
If you're curious what these different options mean.

05:17.490 --> 05:22.560
So with this Seybold you're disabling encrypted the motion and what you want.

05:22.620 --> 05:30.030
Bear in mind here is when you ve motion a virtual machine you're moving the contents of memory for that

05:30.030 --> 05:37.410
VM across the network so it may make sense to encrypt that traffic.

05:37.430 --> 05:42.390
Unless you're on a network that you trust if you trust the network and you're not going to worry about

05:42.390 --> 05:46.660
encryption go hadn't said this to disable opportunistic.

05:46.890 --> 05:56.130
Basically means if it can it will if both hosts support encryption and support encrypted emotion then

05:56.130 --> 06:01.510
encrypted E-motion will be used if one of the hosts does not support it.

06:01.590 --> 06:08.730
The motion will still happen but it will happen on encrypted and then finally the third option is required.

06:08.940 --> 06:15.780
And so if you set this to required that means that a V motion can only occur if both the source and

06:15.780 --> 06:20.520
destination hosts support V motion in an encrypted fashion.

06:21.640 --> 06:26.130
So that's how you enable encrypted Wii motion on a virtual machine.

06:27.040 --> 06:32.560
So those are the security settings that we want to take a look at in regards to our VM is that we need

06:32.560 --> 06:33.310
to be aware of.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.010
For the VCP exam.

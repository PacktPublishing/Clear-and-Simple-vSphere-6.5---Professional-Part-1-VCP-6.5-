00:00.400 --> 00:07.170
In this video I'll demonstrate some of the security settings that you can modify for your ESX I hosts.

00:07.320 --> 00:12.540
And so here you can see I've logged into my Vee's for a web client and I'm at the hosts and Klosters

00:12.540 --> 00:19.470
view and I'm going to pick this ESX I host here and go ahead and click on the configure tab and this

00:19.470 --> 00:25.710
is where you're basically going to configure everything for this ESX I host whether it's virtual switches

00:25.710 --> 00:31.230
or storage adapters or security settings.

00:31.340 --> 00:37.580
And so our security settings are primarily listed here under the security profile.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.940
And let's start with the first option here.

00:39.980 --> 00:41.820
The host firewall.

00:42.140 --> 00:48.380
So this firewall is for traffic coming in and out of the host itself or for functions that the host

00:48.380 --> 00:50.270
itself needs to perform.

00:50.270 --> 00:54.170
This is not a firewall that protects your virtual machines.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.250
None of the rules in here are going to be applied to any of your VM.

00:58.400 --> 01:05.480
They're strictly applied to the VM kernel ports of the ESX I host itself.

01:05.920 --> 01:13.090
And so let's take a look let's edit this firewall and I'm going to modify a rule for S-sh And so here

01:13.090 --> 01:15.510
we see our S-sh server.

01:15.910 --> 01:24.250
So the ESX host isn't as as a server meaning I can launch PADI or some other similar program and connect

01:24.250 --> 01:28.260
to a command line interface on this ESX I host.

01:28.430 --> 01:36.260
I may want to take that traffic and limit it to a certain range of IP addresses like let's say my management

01:36.260 --> 01:43.090
network has 1 9 2 1 6 8 dot 10 dot 0 slash 24.

01:43.100 --> 01:49.730
Now what I can do is I can take that S-sh port and I can limit it to the addresses that I know should

01:49.730 --> 01:52.380
specifically be able to connect to it.

01:52.480 --> 01:52.900
Right.

01:52.970 --> 01:59.030
And I can do the same thing for a traffic like DHC P or DNS traffic.

01:59.170 --> 02:02.990
Here's our DHP client Here's wake on LAN.

02:02.990 --> 02:07.940
Here is DNS a.p and so on and so forth.

02:08.210 --> 02:15.080
So if there are certain types of traffic that you know should be limited to certain IP addresses such

02:15.080 --> 02:23.410
as DNS for example and you want to go ahead and modify this host firewall to limit the attack surface

02:23.450 --> 02:30.580
as much as you possibly can by restricting that traffic to the appropriate IP address ranges.

02:31.070 --> 02:38.060
And by the way if you end up doing host profiles all of these firewall settings are captured in a host

02:38.060 --> 02:45.500
profile so that can be a great way to standardize all of these firewall settings across a large number

02:45.500 --> 02:47.350
of ESX hosts.

02:47.490 --> 02:54.270
And that way you don't have to configure this every time you set up a new ESX host.

02:54.780 --> 02:59.160
Also on the host we can configure services.

02:59.550 --> 03:05.040
So let's click at 8 here and what we're basically doing is stopping and starting services.

03:05.460 --> 03:13.450
So if we look at S-sh right now the services stopped and I have it configured to start and stop manually.

03:13.570 --> 03:20.400
So if I want to I can manually start the S-sh service and now it's running.

03:20.630 --> 03:24.960
But the best practice is actually to leave S-sh stopped.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.300
But I'm just enabling it now to demonstrate the process.

03:28.320 --> 03:35.760
And if I want to I could also say start and stop with host that way any time this host is booted up

03:36.630 --> 03:39.420
the S-sh service will be started automatically.

03:42.470 --> 03:44.510
And there's a number of other services here.

03:44.690 --> 03:51.700
So what we want to do is consider what services are we actually using and stop any services that we

03:51.700 --> 03:58.390
don't actually need running to limit the attack surface the third setting that I want to show you on

03:58.390 --> 04:08.350
the screen is called lockdown mode and lockdown mode is used to basically restrict how an ESX host can

04:08.350 --> 04:10.090
be communicated with.

04:10.090 --> 04:16.480
So if I hit it here on the lockdown mode screen I can choose from three modes right by default lockdown

04:16.480 --> 04:17.510
mode is disabled.

04:18.970 --> 04:25.900
If I choose normal lockdown mode what that means is that this host will only be accessible through the

04:25.900 --> 04:34.840
local DC Why that local console or through the center which means I will no longer be able to launch

04:34.840 --> 04:37.270
party and connect to it via S-sh.

04:37.270 --> 04:42.770
I will no longer be able to launch the host client and connect to it directly with that.

04:42.970 --> 04:50.890
The purpose of normal lockdown mode is to force all of the management traffic to come through the center.

04:51.590 --> 04:58.460
But if something goes wrong and Visa enters unable to connect to my host then I can always go to the

04:58.460 --> 05:03.410
local console and connect to it there and turn off lockdown mode if I need to.

05:03.740 --> 05:09.590
With strict lockdown mode this is by far the most restrictive option and you'll see it will warn you

05:09.590 --> 05:18.150
here it'll say the direct console user interface service is stopped meaning if I choose strict lockdown

05:18.150 --> 05:23.010
mode the only way I can connect to that host is through the center.

05:23.010 --> 05:24.540
That's it.

05:24.540 --> 05:30.690
If the center fails and I can't get it back up I'm going to have to re-image this host because the only

05:30.690 --> 05:33.580
way that this host can be accessed is through the center.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.750
And that's it.

05:34.770 --> 05:37.610
So strict is very very strict.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.250
Right.

05:38.700 --> 05:42.510
And so in most cases we'll probably go with disabled or normal.

05:42.510 --> 05:46.100
I'm going to go ahead and disable this and hit OK here.

05:46.530 --> 05:48.020
So that's lockdown mode.

05:48.060 --> 05:54.480
And the last thing I want to show you here is under authentication services we can join our ESX I host

05:54.480 --> 05:55.740
to a domain.

05:55.930 --> 05:59.880
So I'm going to join this host to the lab that local domain.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.980
This is an active directory domain.

06:02.240 --> 06:08.560
My user name is going to be administrator and he any active directory domain that Ben will work here.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.070
I'll put in my password and hit OK.

06:12.360 --> 06:24.850
And now issue will the join this ESX host to the domain.

06:25.270 --> 06:29.650
And here you can see we've successfully joined the lab at local domain.

06:29.650 --> 06:35.480
The purpose of this is really I don't want to share our root credentials.

06:35.680 --> 06:40.690
So if we have our ESX I hope that is not a member of any domain.

06:40.750 --> 06:45.200
You can still create some local users inside that ESX I host.

06:45.310 --> 06:47.660
But most people tend not to do that.

06:47.740 --> 06:55.100
And what you see a lot of in the real world is people sharing those root credentials for the ESX host.

06:55.240 --> 07:01.030
So rather than checking out those credentials we'll go ahead and join our host to a domain and that

07:01.030 --> 07:09.190
way we can allow people to authenticate to this ESX host using their actual active directory domain

07:09.190 --> 07:10.120
credentials.

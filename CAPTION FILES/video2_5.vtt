In this video I'll explain and demonstrate how to configure encrypted vse Ferebee motion.

00:06.620 --> 00:14.480
This is a new feature that was released with these fair 6.5 and by default encrypted VM motion will

00:14.480 --> 00:21.110
be supported and enabled across your vse fair 6.5 ESX I hosts.

00:21.110 --> 00:26.080
And so what we're looking at right here is the documentation that breaks down this new feature.

00:26.600 --> 00:32.660
So for Virgin machines that are encrypted like if you've encrypted the virtual disk of your virtual

00:32.660 --> 00:38.430
machines and encrypted these for every motion is always used and is required.

00:38.540 --> 00:45.290
But for virtual machines that you have not encrypted the virtual disk of you can choose how you want

00:45.350 --> 00:48.120
the host to handle encrypted Wii motion.

00:48.320 --> 00:48.710
So.

00:48.800 --> 00:54.310
So you can choose disabled in which case encrypted Wii motion will not be used.

00:54.770 --> 01:00.440
You can choose the default which is opportunistic and with opportunistic.

01:00.440 --> 01:07.280
What this means is that if both the source and destination hosts support an encrypted Wii motion then

01:07.310 --> 01:11.100
your VM will be migrated using an encrypted Wii motion.

01:11.570 --> 01:17.410
But if one of the hosts does not support it then an unencrypted Wii Motion can still be used.

01:17.480 --> 01:25.260
That is the case unless we explicitly choose required where virtual machines can not be Wii motioned

01:25.640 --> 01:28.710
unless encrypted Wii motion is possible.

01:29.650 --> 01:36.970
Now as we're migrating virtual machines with Wii motion we have to bear in mind we're moving the contents

01:37.060 --> 01:39.140
of the virtual machines memory.

01:39.700 --> 01:46.660
And so this content can be pretty sensitive and that's really the rationale behind creating the ability

01:46.660 --> 01:48.490
to do an encrypted Wii motion.

01:48.820 --> 01:53.920
So the configuration of encrypted Wii motion on a VM is actually pretty straightforward.

01:53.920 --> 02:04.300
I'm going to Right-Click this VM go to Edit sendings and under VM options I have the option to choose

02:04.600 --> 02:12.790
my the motion settings so I'll expand encryption and under encryption I can choose whether I want to

02:12.820 --> 02:19.450
stick with the default which is opportunistic which will try to do an encrypted Wii motion if it's possible

02:19.510 --> 02:26.350
but if it's not possible it will still carry out an unencrypted Wii motion or I can choose required

02:26.350 --> 02:27.840
or disable.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.380
So a few different options there for this particular VM.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.560
I'm going to choose opportunistic.

02:33.730 --> 02:36.610
I'll leave it at the defaults and go ahead and head OK.

In this video I'll explain private villans private villans are a feature that supported on the Wii's

00:07.340 --> 00:14.020
fair distributed switch and they can be used to isolate traffic within a LAN.

00:14.050 --> 00:23.110
So for example in this slide we see virtual machines that are all on the same network the 10 dot 1.1

00:23.180 --> 00:25.610
that zero network.

00:25.650 --> 00:31.860
Now maybe these virtual machines are owned by different departments or different tenants and we need

00:31.860 --> 00:34.760
to create some sort of isolation between them.

00:36.300 --> 00:43.590
All of our virtual machines are in primary Vili's and 10 but secondary villans have also been created

00:44.950 --> 00:49.730
and two of these victims are in an isolated secondary plan.

00:49.810 --> 00:56.620
Now that means that these virtual machines can only communicate with virtual machines that are connected

00:56.920 --> 00:58.250
to promiscuous ports

01:04.360 --> 01:11.780
even virtual machines within the same secondary isolated Villon can not communicate with each other.

01:11.860 --> 01:16.590
They can only communicate to VMI that are connected to a promiscuous port.

01:16.990 --> 01:23.050
So maybe the two virtual machines connected to secondary Villon and one 10 belong to different departments

01:23.050 --> 01:24.290
or different companies.

01:24.490 --> 01:31.090
They're isolated from each other and they can only communicate with perhaps a router that's on a permit

01:31.130 --> 01:33.510
cueist port.

01:33.520 --> 01:41.170
We also have community villans So notice in red and blue we have primary Vili's 10 and secondary villin

01:41.240 --> 01:48.580
111 and in blue we have primary Villalon 10 and secondary Villalon 112 and those have been defined as

01:48.580 --> 01:57.390
community villans the AMS within the same community can connect with each other they can communicate

01:57.390 --> 01:59.460
within their community LAN

02:02.280 --> 02:10.950
they can also communicate with the promiscuous violent however communities cannot communicate with each

02:10.950 --> 02:12.170
other.

02:12.180 --> 02:19.320
So for example if one of the virtual machines in secondary Vili's and one 11 tries to connect to one

02:19.320 --> 02:23.390
of the virtual machines and secondary v. LAN 1:12 that traffic will not be allowed.

02:25.380 --> 02:32.580
And again all virtual machines in all secondary villans can always communicate with anything thats connected

02:32.580 --> 02:35.430
to a promiscuous secondary via LAN.

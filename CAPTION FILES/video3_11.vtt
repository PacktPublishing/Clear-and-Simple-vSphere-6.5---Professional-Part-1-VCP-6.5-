00:00.270 --> 00:05.760
In this video I'll demonstrate how to configure private lands in a sphere distributed switch.

00:05.820 --> 00:11.280
So here you can see I'm logged into my vees for web climb and the networking view yet again and I've

00:11.280 --> 00:15.600
gone to my VCP demo distributed switch and configure.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.030
I have the ability to establish private villans.

00:19.080 --> 00:25.740
Now real quick before I do that I'm going to go ahead and add a couple new distributed port groups here

00:26.100 --> 00:28.630
just for the purposes of demo ing this.

00:28.710 --> 00:31.740
So I'm going to create one port group called Shared Services.

00:31.740 --> 00:37.340
This is my fictional port group that every bunny needs to have access to.

00:37.470 --> 00:42.530
And so I'm going to establish this as a port group that everybody can reach.

00:42.540 --> 00:48.580
So that's my shared services port group then I'm going to create another port group.

00:48.600 --> 00:55.020
I'm going to call it tennents so connecting to this port group will be a bunch of different tenants.

00:55.290 --> 01:01.590
And the goal is that these tenants should be able to communicate with the shared services but they should

01:01.590 --> 01:04.930
not be able to communicate with each other.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.620
And then I'm going to create two more port groups that we're going to use to demonstrate community violence.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.540
So create a new distributed group.

01:13.610 --> 01:17.470
This one is going to be called ABC team one.

01:17.780 --> 01:24.320
So just think of this ABC team one group as one in which we are going to connect a bunch of virtual

01:24.320 --> 01:30.690
machines from a company called ABC and they want to be able to communicate with each other but they

01:30.690 --> 01:34.780
should not be able to communicate with any of these other tenants.

01:34.830 --> 01:41.410
And I'm also going to create one last port group I'm going to call it X Y Z team one.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.460
This is a different company.

01:43.680 --> 01:48.030
And again they're going to have multiple virtual machines connecting to this port group that need to

01:48.030 --> 01:49.180
be able to communicate.

01:49.450 --> 01:52.150
But X Y Z is a different company than ABC.

01:52.350 --> 01:57.100
So their machines should not be able to communicate with each other.

01:57.120 --> 02:03.420
So now I've got all of these different groups with all of these different communications requirements.

02:03.570 --> 02:04.110
Right.

02:04.260 --> 02:09.510
Everything and ABC team one should be able to communicate with everything an ABC team want.

02:09.510 --> 02:14.520
Same thing with x y z team won everything in this group should be able to communicate with everything

02:14.610 --> 02:15.840
else in this group.

02:16.140 --> 02:19.170
But the two groups cannot communicate with each other.

02:20.550 --> 02:25.090
However they can communicate with shared services.

02:25.230 --> 02:27.530
So can my tenants.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.780
Tenants cannot communicate directly with each other.

02:30.870 --> 02:33.040
They could be virtual machines on the same port group.

02:33.090 --> 02:35.100
I do not want them to be able to communicate.

02:35.130 --> 02:42.160
The only thing that my tenants should be able to communicate with is shared services and thats at.

02:42.180 --> 02:48.540
So the only way that I can accomplish this is to configure private lands.

02:48.780 --> 02:50.720
So here's what we're going to do.

02:50.730 --> 02:54.130
We're going to go ahead and create a primary villain.

02:54.150 --> 03:01.190
I'm going to call the primary villain 10 and then I'm going to have a secondary villain of ten which

03:01.200 --> 03:06.680
is promiscuous and this is going to be the villain that he use for shared services.

03:06.750 --> 03:14.760
Promiscuous can communicate with anything else I'm going to create two community events so I'm going

03:14.760 --> 03:23.790
to call these community relations 101 and 102 these are my secondary lands sort of like a VPN within

03:23.790 --> 03:29.490
a villain and then I'm going to create a third secondary villain.

03:29.550 --> 03:36.170
This one is going to be an isolated secondary villain all secondary between two and one.

03:36.480 --> 03:42.380
So you'll notice the primary v is the same primary between 10.

03:42.390 --> 03:50.970
That means that any machines connected to ABC team 1 shared services tennents X Y Z team one they're

03:50.970 --> 03:58.680
actually all in VLAN 10 and they can actually all have IP addresses in the same subnet as each other.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.580
It's as if they're all in one VPN.

04:01.590 --> 04:09.630
But within that Lan I am craving certain rules to govern which groups can communicate with which groups

04:09.960 --> 04:14.030
which VM can communicate with which the AMS.

04:14.760 --> 04:20.330
And so now I have created my private view and structure.

04:20.550 --> 04:23.600
Let's start with my shared services

04:27.950 --> 04:31.840
and other properties I'm going to go to Edit

04:35.930 --> 04:37.090
and Valium.

04:37.400 --> 04:46.340
I am now going to choose private land and this is going to be associated with my promiscuous private

04:46.340 --> 04:53.360
Villon meaning anything I'm Villalon 10 whether it's in a community or an isolated it doesn't matter

04:53.780 --> 04:59.710
anything with movieland time can communicate with this particular portrait.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.330
It is promiscuous.

05:02.940 --> 05:04.880
Then I've got my tenants.

05:05.180 --> 05:09.470
These are reports that a bunch of different clients are going to connect to.

05:09.710 --> 05:14.000
And so I've got all of these different clients creating virtual machines that are going to connect to

05:14.000 --> 05:15.590
this group.

05:15.710 --> 05:21.180
I want to make sure that those different clients cannot communicate directly with one another.

05:21.470 --> 05:28.400
So I'm going to make this an isolated secondary Villon that means that I can have 100 virtual machines

05:28.400 --> 05:30.110
hooked up to this Tennent's port group.

05:30.170 --> 05:32.020
None of them can talk to each other.

05:32.030 --> 05:39.090
The only thing that they can communicate with is promiscuous which is shared services.

05:39.820 --> 05:44.840
And then we've got ABC team one again I'm going to edit this.

05:44.860 --> 05:50.140
We're going to go to the villans settings and I'm going to associate this with a community violation

05:50.620 --> 05:58.840
a little bit different than my isolated Villon because in a community private VLAN that means that any

05:58.840 --> 06:03.250
machines connected to this poor group can communicate with each other.

06:03.760 --> 06:09.290
Unlike tenants they could not communicate with each other in the secondary Villon they can.

06:09.640 --> 06:17.460
And I'll give X Y Z team one its own community land separate from the community Villon that I assigned

06:17.470 --> 06:19.730
to ABC team one.

06:20.050 --> 06:26.500
So let's go to VPN let's pick the secondary community via land that I created which I think it was 102.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.930
And there we go.

06:27.940 --> 06:36.070
So now I've established one single Valium villans hat with a bunch of secondary villans inside of it.

06:36.070 --> 06:39.940
And each of those secondary villans has different types of behavior.

06:39.940 --> 06:43.330
Promiscuous talks to anything it wants isolated.

06:43.330 --> 06:44.940
They don't talk to anybody.

06:44.940 --> 06:50.110
The only thing an isolated secondary Villon can talk to is a promiscuous secondary Viola.

06:50.560 --> 06:56.930
And then I've got my two communities one community for ABC team one and one community for X Y Z team

06:56.930 --> 07:01.980
one both of which can also communicate with my shared services.

07:02.480 --> 07:09.130
So that's a quick look at how to create private villans and an example of a really basic use case where

07:09.140 --> 07:11.640
private villans might make sense.

In this video I'll demonstrate how to use the different TCAP piece tax that are available in these fairs

00:05.900 --> 00:07.770
6.5.

00:07.840 --> 00:14.230
So I'm going to start by navigating two hosts and Klosters and I'm going to pick my first ESX host here

00:15.470 --> 00:25.060
and under configure we can see networking and TCAP IP configuration and other TCAP IP configuration.

00:25.060 --> 00:28.840
We can see the default TCAP IP stack.

00:28.870 --> 00:34.990
You can see the provisioning TZP IP stack and we can see the emotion TCAP IP stack.

00:35.020 --> 00:38.760
So these are the three TCAP IP stacks that we have in here.

00:38.760 --> 00:47.050
By default I've got our little edit button up here a little pencil icon that we can click on to configure

00:47.050 --> 00:51.350
things like for example a different DNS server.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.670
Under routing we can configure a different default gateway.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.720
And so let's just kind of think about what we have here.

00:59.490 --> 01:08.800
What we can do for Wii motion in this case is set a different default gateway set a different DNS server.

01:09.150 --> 01:17.070
And so if I want to direct my VM ocean traffic over some different physical network I can do that by

01:17.070 --> 01:24.480
placing it on a different TCAP IP stack then my default with IP stack which has a different DNS server

01:24.960 --> 01:26.230
a different default gateway.

01:27.980 --> 01:31.600
And that's the purpose of these different TCAP IP stacks.

01:31.640 --> 01:38.930
So we see here our Wii motion TCAP IP stack and if we go under networking and we take a look at our

01:38.930 --> 01:45.690
VM kernel adapters here here we see a management VM kernel port.

01:45.740 --> 01:51.700
Let's take a quick look at this VM kernel port and we don't want to show you here is under the VM kernel

01:51.700 --> 01:56.520
ports themselves we have the ability to change the TCAP IP stack.

01:56.860 --> 02:02.950
So if I were to create an additional VM kernel port let's add in a new VM kernel port and let's just

02:02.950 --> 02:11.070
pretend that this VM kernel port is going to be dedicated specifically to the motion.

02:11.170 --> 02:18.850
So I'm going to pick which network to place does VM kernel Poorna just pick a network at random here.

02:20.980 --> 02:21.870
And I'll hit next.

02:21.870 --> 02:24.480
Now in real life you wouldn't pick a network at random.

02:24.620 --> 02:27.520
You put it on the appropriate the Lamb.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.760
So here's why the motion VM kernel port.

02:30.450 --> 02:35.640
Then here I can go ahead and say OK for this particular VM kernel port I'm going to choose a different

02:35.640 --> 02:37.080
TCAP IP stack.

02:37.230 --> 02:39.750
The VM motion TZP IP stack.

02:39.870 --> 02:48.150
So as I establish new VM kernel Porus I can choose the appropriate IP stack that supports those services

02:48.600 --> 02:52.910
and basically force that VM kernel ports traffic over a different network.

02:53.160 --> 03:00.430
And you can even create your own custom TCAP IP stacks and vees for 6.5.

03:00.450 --> 03:05.730
So that's what you really need to understand for the exam is the fact that we have these different TCAP

03:05.730 --> 03:08.010
IP stacks available now.

03:08.070 --> 03:14.270
Are Here are two TCAP IP configuration and by default we have our default ECPA IP stack which is used

03:14.280 --> 03:20.240
for everything provisioning and then our Wii motion TCAP IP stack.

03:20.640 --> 03:26.400
And again the motion traffic is all going to go through the false stack unless I specifically go to

03:26.400 --> 03:31.010
that VM kernel part and tell it to use the Wii motion TCAP IP stack.

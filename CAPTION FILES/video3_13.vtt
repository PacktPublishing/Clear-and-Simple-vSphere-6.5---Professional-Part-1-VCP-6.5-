In this demo I'll demonstrate how to configure port mirroring on the VSE fair distributed switch.

00:07.130 --> 00:13.610
So first off the purpose of mirroring is to duplicate the traffic and a distributed port or maybe even

00:13.610 --> 00:20.100
multiple distributed ports and send a copy of it to some sort of destination.

00:20.180 --> 00:24.070
And so I'm going to start out by choosing my Vee's for a distributed switch here.

00:24.080 --> 00:33.550
VCP demo and under the configure menu you can see mirroring and if I click on new here that gives us

00:33.550 --> 00:39.490
the ability to go ahead and create a new port mirroring session.

00:39.610 --> 00:41.940
So the first session type is pretty straightforward.

00:41.950 --> 00:49.600
Here we are mirroring traffic from one set of distributed ports to another set of distributed ports.

00:49.600 --> 00:54.510
So we must be using a virtual machine to actually monitor that traffic.

00:54.700 --> 01:00.490
And then we've got remote mirroring source and remote mirroring destination.

01:00.520 --> 01:07.630
So with a remote mirroring source what we're doing is we're mirroring traffic from a set of distributed

01:07.630 --> 01:11.390
ports to specific physical uplink ports.

01:11.410 --> 01:16.430
This is like in our span session we're going to have something in the physical network.

01:17.250 --> 01:20.990
That is actually going to be receiving that traffic out.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.280
One of the uplinks of my ESX host and monitoring that traffic or if I want to do an hour span session

01:29.310 --> 01:37.980
in reverse I can have remote mirroring destination meaning traffic is coming from a set of virtual lands

01:38.760 --> 01:42.320
and is being received by a distributed port.

01:42.330 --> 01:47.250
We also have encapsulated remote mirroring layer 3 source.

01:47.250 --> 01:52.320
So we're going to take traffic that's going to set up distributed ports and Sandomir or copy of it to

01:52.320 --> 01:59.090
a particular IP address that IP address could be a virtual machine it could be a physical server somewhere.

01:59.140 --> 02:04.900
And so I'm just going to go with the first option here which is called distributed port mirroring and

02:04.900 --> 02:06.270
I'm going to give it a name.

02:06.380 --> 02:08.940
I can choose whether I want to enable or disable it.

02:08.980 --> 02:10.970
At the moment I'm just going to leave it disabled.

02:11.710 --> 02:19.220
And now I can say OK I am mirroring traffic from one port to another on the destination poor.

02:19.300 --> 02:26.800
Is it purely going to be used to receive this traffic or can the machine on the destination port generate

02:26.800 --> 02:28.100
its own traffic.

02:28.240 --> 02:35.020
I'm going to allow it to and that I can adjust the granularity here I can change the sampling rate higher

02:35.020 --> 02:38.290
or lower if I'd like to I'm going to leave it at the defaults.

02:38.590 --> 02:41.620
And then what you can do is choose the source and destination port.

02:42.040 --> 02:49.330
And in order to choose a source port there has to actually be a virtual machine connected to that poor

02:49.360 --> 02:50.530
and power down.

02:50.680 --> 02:57.460
So I'm going to choose this one particular poor as my source port and then I'll choose a different port

02:57.460 --> 03:04.900
which would be probably like some kind of monitoring virtual machine or maybe a sniffer or an intrusion

03:04.900 --> 03:11.440
prevention system or who knows what but something that I want to actually have receive a mirror copy

03:11.440 --> 03:14.160
of all of this traffic on a different port.

03:14.470 --> 03:19.220
And so this is really the most basic kind of port mirroring session that you can set up.

03:19.300 --> 03:25.410
And now all of the traffic that's received on my source port will be automatically mirrored to my destination

03:25.410 --> 03:25.970
port.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.430
So that's how we can figure port mirroring session.

03:30.130 --> 03:35.390
Now a couple of things that I do just want to mention when you're configuring a mirroring session one

03:35.400 --> 03:41.850
of the settings that it kind of zipped past a little bit quickly here was the mirrored packet like.

03:42.040 --> 03:47.440
And you'll notice we have the ability to basically say what does the packet length that we actually

03:47.440 --> 03:51.010
want to duplicate and send a copy of that traffic to.

03:51.100 --> 03:57.210
And so here we see it's 60 bytes is the length that's configured here.

03:57.280 --> 04:03.070
If I choose to do this only the first 60 bytes of each packet is actually going to be mirrored.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.220
I think you will why would I want to do that.

04:05.220 --> 04:08.070
Why wouldn't I just mirror the entire package.

04:08.290 --> 04:14.980
Well most of the time when you're setting up a mirroring session you're not actually trying to capture

04:15.130 --> 04:21.100
all of the data that the source machine is actually sending or receiving.

04:21.280 --> 04:27.670
What you're really trying to do is analyze those packet headers and so you don't necessarily have to

04:27.670 --> 04:31.110
capture the entire packet in order to do that.

04:31.180 --> 04:36.100
So that's the final piece that I just wanted to go back and revisit quickly and explain why you have

04:36.100 --> 04:40.030
the ability to override that mirrored packet length.

04:40.030 --> 04:48.160
Now when you're planning on taking the exam my recommendation would be to be able to briefly describe

04:48.370 --> 04:54.460
each of these different port mirroring session types and understand at a very basic level what each

04:54.460 --> 04:57.060
of these port marrying sessions does.

04:57.310 --> 05:01.560
So be familiar with that before you go and set your VCP exam.

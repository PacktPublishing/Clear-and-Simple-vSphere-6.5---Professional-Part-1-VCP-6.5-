00:00.170 --> 00:05.100
In this video I'll demonstrate how to create a fair distributed switch.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.150
So here I am with the homescreen of these for web client.

00:08.580 --> 00:13.080
And you can see in my environment here I've got to ESX I hosts.

00:13.080 --> 00:19.230
So I want to create a Vee's for a distributed switch that will span both of these ESX I hosts.

00:19.230 --> 00:24.480
So I'm going to go to networking and you can see here I've already got a viz for a distributed switch

00:24.480 --> 00:27.920
that I've created before I'm going to create one more.

00:28.080 --> 00:28.700
So let's.

00:28.710 --> 00:35.040
Right click my virtual data center here and I'm going to go to a distributed switch and click on new

00:35.040 --> 00:44.610
distributed switch and on a new distributed switch I'm going to call this the VCP demo click on next

00:45.560 --> 00:48.700
and I'm going to choose the version of my vse for a distributed switch.

00:48.710 --> 00:53.330
I know that all of my hosts are ESX I 6.5 or later.

00:53.510 --> 00:55.780
So that will be just fine.

00:55.790 --> 01:00.780
So I'm going to go ahead and hit next Herr I get to choose the number of uplinks.

01:00.830 --> 01:07.440
And in this scenario I'm just going to leave it at the default for network IO control is currently enabled.

01:07.460 --> 01:12.530
I'll leave that enabled and I do want to create a default port group.

01:12.630 --> 01:22.140
So I'm going to call it my VM network and I'm just going to call it DP g to make it easy to differentiate

01:22.140 --> 01:24.840
this from any standard port groups that might exist.

01:25.850 --> 01:29.900
And then I'll hit next and finish.

01:29.930 --> 01:30.890
And so that's it.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.080
I've now created a VSE fair distributed switch.

01:35.240 --> 01:40.190
So the fact that I've created a Vee's for distributes which doesn't really mean much of anything at

01:40.190 --> 01:41.250
this point.

01:41.280 --> 01:45.120
I've created a discriminants which is not really doing anything.

01:45.200 --> 01:51.260
If I click on the distributed switch and come over here to the right you can see that this particular

01:51.260 --> 01:56.900
distributed switch is not currently associated with any ESX I hosts.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.120
So that's my next step.

01:59.120 --> 02:06.390
I'm going to go ahead and click on Add and manage hosts then I'm going to add some new host to this

02:06.390 --> 02:08.210
Vee's for a distributed switch.

02:08.220 --> 02:17.940
Now what this essentially means is that I've got this centralized configuration that's what I've created

02:17.940 --> 02:19.030
so far.

02:19.060 --> 02:23.490
Right if credit is distributed switch I've created a distributed port group.

02:23.550 --> 02:28.830
I haven't really modified the settings on it very much but there are security policy settings and all

02:28.830 --> 02:30.680
that stuff is baked into this.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.350
These are distributed switch configuration.

02:33.630 --> 02:43.650
And so when I add hosts What I'm essentially doing is pushing this configuration down to these ESX hosts

02:43.710 --> 02:48.260
and making this distributed switch available on those hosts.

02:49.570 --> 02:53.620
So I've got to ESX I host I'm going to select both of them.

02:54.200 --> 03:02.030
I'm going to click on next and I'm not going to manage any of my V.M. Colonel Portes I've got management

03:02.030 --> 03:05.370
VM Colonel Portes created on each of these hosts.

03:05.420 --> 03:07.100
They're actually in a standard switch.

03:07.250 --> 03:12.570
I'm going to leave those alone if I wanted to I could migrate those but I'm not going to do that.

03:12.830 --> 03:17.060
I am going to however manage my physical adapter so we'll take a look at that.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.000
And so basically here is how this works.

03:23.270 --> 03:32.660
I've got physical adapters on these ESX I hosts and each physical adapter can only be used by one virtual

03:32.660 --> 03:39.110
switch so you can see on each of these hosts I have three physical adapters and they're all in use.

03:39.180 --> 03:46.610
I'm actually going to grab these physical adapters from a different Vee's for a distributed switch and

03:46.610 --> 03:51.530
steal them for this particular Vee's for a distributed switch.

03:51.530 --> 03:59.250
So I'm going to take the next two and assign it to uplink one on my new distributed switch.

03:59.790 --> 04:07.050
And I'm also getting Rabbe VM next to this other Vee's for a distributed switch and assign that as well

04:07.770 --> 04:09.140
to uplink one.

04:09.660 --> 04:14.120
And so you can see here it's currently in use by the rick Creasey demo video.

04:14.130 --> 04:17.730
DV Yes which is something I created prior.

04:18.180 --> 04:22.750
And I'm changing that hair.

04:22.850 --> 04:27.560
And so now it's going to tell me hey is there any impact to like VM kernel ports or things like that.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.180
There's nothing like that to be concerned with.

04:30.380 --> 04:38.680
So I will finish and if we go ahead and browse back to hostes and Klosters.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.120
Now I've got these two hosts added.

04:42.050 --> 04:44.160
I'm going to go to one of my ESX I host.

04:44.190 --> 04:51.830
I'm going to go to configure and let's see what changes have now taken place with this host now has

04:51.890 --> 04:55.590
the VCP demo virtual switch.

04:55.700 --> 05:03.790
It's got one of its physical adapters allocated to this particular virtual switch VM Nic to.

05:04.090 --> 05:07.620
And if I look at my second ESX host it's going to be the same thing.

05:08.200 --> 05:16.370
This virtual switch is now going to be available on the second ESX host and VM to as I've configured

05:16.370 --> 05:18.800
it is now dedicated to this virtual switch.

05:19.040 --> 05:24.740
So that's a simple configuration of a regular fare distributed switch.

In this video I'll demonstrate how to migrate virtual machines to a VSE fair distributed switch.

00:08.040 --> 00:15.320
So here you can see I'm at the networking screen of the Vee's fair web client and I have my VCP Dasch

00:15.320 --> 00:21.200
demo distributed switch that I created in a prior video and I'm going to right click that distributed

00:21.200 --> 00:24.770
switch and choose migrate the OEM's to another network.

00:24.770 --> 00:31.580
Now this is one way in which you can take a bunch of virtual machines that are on some specific network

00:32.330 --> 00:40.400
like for example VM network or another distributed port group even and you can migrate a bunch of virtual

00:40.400 --> 00:47.330
machines to a different network like my new network that I created called the VM network DP.

00:47.870 --> 00:50.530
So I'm actually going to change my source network.

00:50.540 --> 00:52.340
I'm going to make it.

00:52.340 --> 00:54.050
Rick Creasey dist.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.210
PGE because I'm pretty sure that's where my virtual machines are currently connected.

00:59.220 --> 01:02.440
And our next and there we go.

01:02.520 --> 01:08.030
I've got a virtual machine that's connected to that group that I can then go ahead and migrate off of

01:08.030 --> 01:10.840
that port group and onto this new port group.

01:10.850 --> 01:17.060
So if you had a whole lot of virtual machines that you needed to migrate from one distributed switch

01:17.060 --> 01:23.810
to another or from a standard switch to a distributed switch this would be a really fast way that you

01:23.810 --> 01:27.370
could do a bunch of those migrations.

01:27.380 --> 01:34.820
The other option is to go to hosts and Klosters grab your virtual machine go to settings on the virtual

01:34.820 --> 01:40.820
machine and under edit settings you can simply change the network that the virtual machine is attached

01:40.820 --> 01:41.980
to there as well.

01:42.260 --> 01:47.810
So here you can see I've got two network adapters I can go ahead and change those to whatever network

01:47.840 --> 01:48.940
I want.

01:49.340 --> 01:55.250
And so now I've connected them both back up to VM network and I'm going to hit OK there so you can do

01:55.250 --> 01:58.440
it one virtual machine at a time in this manner.

01:58.670 --> 02:03.940
Or you can do a mass migration using the first method I showed you.

00:03.690 --> 00:11.520
In this video we'll learn about V.M. where Virtual SAN or VSAN product that leverages the local storage

00:11.520 --> 00:18.280
of ESX I hosts to present high performance shared storage across a cluster.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.120
Now that's a mouthful.

00:20.250 --> 00:24.150
So let's start with the very basics with Virtual SAN.

00:24.180 --> 00:29.350
We are going to allow local storage to be used as shared storage.

00:29.610 --> 00:36.900
And this is really important because for features like Wii motion or high availability or Diyar Ross

00:37.200 --> 00:42.670
we have to have shared storage required shared storage for any of those features.

00:42.690 --> 00:48.810
And so for the motion of VM from one host to another if we're going to enable H.A. across a cluster

00:49.470 --> 00:56.330
and allow virtual machines to fail over across that cluster if a single host fails or if multiple hosts

00:56.340 --> 01:04.420
fails we have to have shared storage or in order to enable those features and same thing for the.

01:04.430 --> 01:09.290
Right if we're going to enable the IRS and same thing with the.

01:09.350 --> 01:15.950
If we're going to enable distributed resource scheduler we have to use the motion for that and therefore

01:15.950 --> 01:18.950
we require shared storage.

01:19.110 --> 01:25.340
So if you're going to set up high availability or dns you need to create a cluster.

01:25.340 --> 01:31.910
Same thing with these and it's graded on the cluster VSX I hosts and it can leverage the local storage

01:32.120 --> 01:40.460
of those ESX hosts in the form of what we call disk groups and this groups our local storage that is

01:40.460 --> 01:48.500
combined to form one large data store that's accessible to all the hosts in the cluster and that data

01:48.500 --> 01:55.130
store is going to have SSD caching capability.

01:55.160 --> 02:03.940
So I read cache and the write buffer built right into it to give high performance.

02:03.950 --> 02:04.300
All right.

02:04.340 --> 02:10.670
So it started with the very basics here that needs to be enabled on an ESX host cluster.

02:10.830 --> 02:15.420
You can create clusters for a number of different purposes.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.820
It's essentially just a logical grouping of VSX I host.

02:20.880 --> 02:21.170
Right.

02:21.180 --> 02:26.110
So for example let's say you have these four ESX host.

02:26.130 --> 02:28.940
We see here in a VM is running on Host 1.

02:29.370 --> 02:37.140
Well if we go ahead and we group those hosts available as a cluster we can enable high availability

02:37.530 --> 02:42.340
and if one of those hosts fails the VM will reboot on some other host.

02:42.540 --> 02:51.840
Or we can enable digress to have virtual machines automatically load balance across those hosts or we

02:51.840 --> 02:55.470
can enable virtual sent the sam.

02:55.920 --> 03:04.220
So these are all different features that are available only on a cluster of ESX hosts.

03:04.320 --> 03:10.750
So the storage on our ESX I host is going to be organized in something called disk groups.

03:10.860 --> 03:17.940
That's the that's the logical unit of storage that virtual saying is going to essentially consume and

03:17.940 --> 03:20.520
share out across the closter.

03:20.520 --> 03:25.560
So here on ESX 0 1 you can see we've got two disk groups.

03:25.590 --> 03:30.430
Each disk group in this case has six hard disk drives in one solid state drive.

03:30.550 --> 03:39.930
You know host 0 2 has one disk group 0 0 3 has one disk group and you can set this up to automatically

03:39.930 --> 03:40.520
happen.

03:40.540 --> 03:41.120
All right.

03:41.190 --> 03:45.570
So it's called disk claim mode and Virtual SAN.

03:45.630 --> 03:49.500
And you can set up what's called automatic disk Quain mode.

03:49.500 --> 03:57.750
So what that means is that as you install SSD and hard disk drives onto your ESX I hope they will be

03:57.840 --> 04:03.170
automatically claimed and allocated to the SAN disk groups.

04:04.020 --> 04:11.880
Or you can use what's called Manual claim mode and in manual claim mode you will manually create the

04:11.880 --> 04:19.290
disk groups and choose which storage devices go in which disk group.

04:19.530 --> 04:22.790
There's really only a few rules that you have to bear in mind.

04:23.280 --> 04:29.510
So for each disk group you have to have at least one SSD device right.

04:30.000 --> 04:40.230
And then you can either have a group of one or more magnetic devices like hard disk drives and those

04:40.230 --> 04:43.320
are called our capacity devices.

04:43.360 --> 04:51.590
So the purpose of the SSD is purely to be used as a read cache and a write buffer.

04:52.040 --> 04:58.790
The purpose of the capacity devices which in this case are hard disk drives is the persistent storage

04:58.790 --> 04:59.300
of data.

04:59.300 --> 05:07.230
The long term persistent storage of data and these capacity devices we have a couple of options here.

05:07.440 --> 05:07.920
Right.

05:07.940 --> 05:15.130
In a hybrid configuration the capacity devices are going to be hard disk drives.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.820
That's our hybrid configuration.

05:17.990 --> 05:20.390
Right it's part SSD part.

05:20.390 --> 05:21.580
Hard Disk.

05:22.220 --> 05:25.760
Or we could go with an all flash configuration.

05:25.760 --> 05:36.440
In which case our cache device will be SSD and all of these capacity devices will also be SSD.

05:36.550 --> 05:42.780
And I know my highlighter doesn't really make a great pen here but that says SSD.

05:42.890 --> 05:52.600
So that's the all flash configuration which obviously is going to outperform the hybrid configuration.

05:52.600 --> 06:01.700
Right so if you need extremely fast all flash performance then you should go with an all flash VCR configuration.

06:01.700 --> 06:02.060
Right.

06:02.300 --> 06:09.140
And there's features specifically that make the Flash version a little bit more cost effective because

06:09.140 --> 06:12.170
we all know SSD storage really expensive.

06:12.200 --> 06:12.700
Right.

06:12.740 --> 06:19.850
The price you're going to pay per gigabyte is much higher than you would pay with traditional hard disk

06:19.850 --> 06:20.510
drives.

06:21.870 --> 06:27.440
So going with an all flash configuration can get really expensive really quickly.

06:28.640 --> 06:37.190
Now with that being said the current version of the scene supports features like RAID 6 and RAID 5 array

06:37.310 --> 06:49.010
or coding and other space reclamation techniques specifically on an all flash vse and configuration

06:49.490 --> 06:49.780
right.

06:49.820 --> 06:51.890
Those features are not supported on the hybrid.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.630
They're only support on all flash.

06:54.170 --> 07:00.160
So if you're kind of thinking well which way should I go should I go all file or should I go hybrid.

07:00.170 --> 07:07.400
Bear that in mind right that if you take advantage of some of the space saving techniques that are introduced

07:07.400 --> 07:18.420
in the current version of VSAN you can potentially get that all flash configuration to approximately

07:18.660 --> 07:24.540
somewhere near the price of your hybrid deployment because of the fact that you can reduce the amount

07:24.540 --> 07:27.740
of data that you need to store.

07:27.760 --> 07:34.320
So I know I kind of diverged off on a bit of a side topic there but back to the very basics right.

07:34.330 --> 07:43.990
So once we've created our ESX I host cluster we can enable virtual San'a we can enable VSAN and at that

07:43.990 --> 07:54.470
point all of those disks in our disk group those centrally be combined to form one big data store called

07:54.460 --> 08:01.060
our vse and data store the data store will be comprised of all of the space provided by the disk groups

08:01.060 --> 08:06.970
on all of the ESX I hosts and the hosts can be part of the cluster even if they don't actually contribute

08:07.150 --> 08:12.940
any storage which is kind of funny to think about but you could potentially add a fourth ESX I host

08:12.940 --> 08:18.140
with no local storage and let it just use the capacity of the data store.

08:19.960 --> 08:25.840
Both that being said you have to have storage on the first three hosts in the cluster.

08:26.120 --> 08:32.170
And most of the time is not really recommended to have a host with no local capacity as part of a VC

08:32.190 --> 08:36.040
and cluster OK.

08:36.110 --> 08:39.290
So the basic concepts of the sand or what we've covered so far.

08:39.290 --> 08:39.610
Right.

08:39.620 --> 08:45.810
We know that number one we're going to leverage local storage to create a shared data store.

08:45.830 --> 08:52.730
We know that that local storage can either be 100 present SSD or it can be a hybrid configuration where

08:52.730 --> 08:56.120
it's got an SSD read cache and write buffer.

08:56.390 --> 09:02.120
But on the back end all of the capacity devices are traditional physical hard disks.

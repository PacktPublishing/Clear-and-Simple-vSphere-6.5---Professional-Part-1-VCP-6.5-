00:00.240 --> 00:09.330
In this video I'll demonstrate how to configure VCM or virtual Sanne on a cluster of ESX hosts.

00:09.400 --> 00:16.630
So as you can see in movies for web client I've actually already created a cluster of ESX I hosts and

00:16.630 --> 00:23.310
that's really the primary prerequisite for virtual Sanne is to go ahead and create that cluster of VSX

00:23.420 --> 00:24.100
hosts.

00:24.310 --> 00:26.330
And so as you can see that's already done.

00:26.530 --> 00:33.160
And if we go to our configure menu here for the cluster itself you can see that with a cluster you can

00:33.160 --> 00:40.540
turn on features like DUI arrests and availability and you can also see under the cluster configuration

00:40.540 --> 00:46.010
area we have VCM and we have the ability to turn on the sand here.

00:46.300 --> 00:52.690
Now before I do that I'm going to configure a few prerequisites here for virtual Sam.

00:53.080 --> 01:00.570
So on this first host you can see that I've got one VM kernel port specifically marked for management.

01:01.180 --> 01:08.680
What I can also do is number one I could potentially edit this VM kernel poor and I could also market

01:08.710 --> 01:11.330
for virtual seÃ¡n traffic.

01:11.420 --> 01:14.160
You can see I've got some other things marked here.

01:14.320 --> 01:19.810
I'm going to a marker for Virtual SAN and I'm going to do the same thing on my other ESX I host.

01:19.810 --> 01:24.040
Now this is fine for a lab environment in real life.

01:24.030 --> 01:29.920
What I really use the same VM kernel port for Wii motion for management for virtual sand.

01:29.950 --> 01:31.750
Probably not.

01:31.910 --> 01:36.580
There's going to be a lot of Virtual SAN traffic flowing over this network.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.740
And so in real life what I would probably do is set up a VM kernel port on a dedicated virtual switch

01:44.980 --> 01:46.490
just for VCM.

01:46.750 --> 01:52.150
I would use dedicated physical switches just for San.

01:52.390 --> 01:54.880
That's really the best way to do this in real life.

01:54.880 --> 02:02.290
You're going to want a dedicated 10 gig network between your ESX hosts just for VCM But this is just

02:02.290 --> 02:02.750
a.

02:02.910 --> 02:04.870
And I'm only using this to demonstrate.

02:04.870 --> 02:11.200
So what I'm going to do in this case is I just need to establish a VM kernel port that is marked to

02:11.200 --> 02:12.840
carry VCM traffic.

02:13.180 --> 02:14.190
And I have done that.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.190
So back to my cluster.

02:16.390 --> 02:19.440
Now I've got my prerequisites satisfied.

02:19.570 --> 02:27.610
I'm going to go ahead and simply turn on the SAN and so will hit the configure button here.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.620
And I'll choose which services I want to enable.

02:31.630 --> 02:36.400
Now notice the first service that's shown D-do application and compression.

02:36.400 --> 02:41.190
This is only available in an all flash configuration.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.150
This only works for all flash disk groups.

02:45.160 --> 02:50.280
What I'm creating here in my demo is a hybrid VCR configuration.

02:50.290 --> 02:56.810
I've got some flash disks that I'm going to use for caching and or as a write buffer.

02:57.890 --> 03:02.030
And I've got some traditional magnetic hard disks.

03:02.030 --> 03:10.520
So in my case I'm not going to enable the space saving features of duplication and compression.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.820
The other thing that's kind of special about my environment.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.620
I've only got two ESX I hosts.

03:18.050 --> 03:25.130
This is the absolute bare minimum for Virtual SAN is what we call a two host cluster.

03:25.130 --> 03:29.270
And we're actually going to have a special third host call the witness how is that we're going to have

03:29.270 --> 03:38.720
to create in this scenario and that significantly increases the complexity of this configuration.

03:38.720 --> 03:44.000
So here's what I want to tell you for your own environments.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.110
This isn't a VCR class and I will be putting out a VCR in class soon but what it will say is that you

03:51.110 --> 03:55.320
don't really want to build a cluster this way unless you have to.

03:55.580 --> 03:59.070
Maybe it's just some small little remote branch and you only have two hosts.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.130
They're fine.

04:01.140 --> 04:08.370
Most cases you're going to be looking for at least four physical hosts in your VCM cluster.

04:08.380 --> 04:17.170
So what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to pause this for a moment and come back to this will

04:17.170 --> 04:23.710
enable VSAN in just a moment and I'm actually going to spin up a third ESX I host so that I can create

04:23.740 --> 04:29.560
a more fully functional vse and cluster.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.850
So I paused my recording and added the third ESX host.

04:33.970 --> 04:40.600
And here you can see it down to the left coast 1 9 2 1 6 8 8 1 9 9 1 0 4.

04:41.050 --> 04:48.810
So at the moment I'm not going to configure for domains or stretch clusters or a To host of VCM cluster.

04:48.910 --> 04:54.070
What I'm going to do is I'm simply going to add the three ESX I hostes that you see here.

04:54.400 --> 05:01.960
Now you'll notice that one of the hosts my new host actually doesn't have a VM kernel port with Virtual

05:01.960 --> 05:05.310
SAN traffic enabled at the moment.

05:05.530 --> 05:08.720
So I have to go back and resolve that.

05:09.040 --> 05:16.510
So I'm going to hit cancel here we'll go to this ESX I host will grab the VM kernel port for management.

05:16.840 --> 05:23.500
And again we're just going to simply edit the management VM kernel port and add vse San as a traffic

05:23.530 --> 05:28.440
type on that I'm going to add Wii motion as well.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.470
We'll go ahead and hit OK and let's try to enable VCM.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.680
One more time.

05:33.880 --> 05:39.750
I'm going to go to my H.A. cluster again and ahint configure for VCO in general.

05:40.170 --> 05:46.390
I'm going to enable the SAN and I'm going to add these three ESX I hosts to V san and now they all have

05:46.390 --> 05:47.350
the kernel port.

05:47.650 --> 05:53.560
So I'll be enabling VCM on all three of these ESX I hosts and I'll hit next here.

05:54.260 --> 06:02.590
And OK so here we see all of the disks that are available on these ESX I hosts.

06:02.590 --> 06:09.850
And so first off we've got some flash disks and we've also got some traditional hard disk drives and

06:09.850 --> 06:15.700
we can see here we've got disks that are flash capacity and we've got disks that are hard disk drive

06:15.730 --> 06:17.260
capacity.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.900
And so let me break them down by host.

06:20.900 --> 06:21.330
All right.

06:21.330 --> 06:33.600
So on host one hundred and host 103 You can see on each of these ESX hosts that I have one flash disk

06:35.490 --> 06:37.910
and two hard disks.

06:37.920 --> 06:42.930
Now if we take a look at the third host Let's expand this guy.

06:42.930 --> 06:47.490
This is the third house is the one that I've added after the fact that it's also the one that seems

06:47.490 --> 06:49.650
to be giving me the most problems.

06:49.650 --> 06:52.580
Notice that it has three hard disks.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.980
That's not going to work.

06:55.080 --> 07:02.640
We can't do this with three hard disks if you're doing the scene in a hybrid configuration.

07:02.640 --> 07:07.500
Each host is going to have a group of disks called the disk group.

07:07.500 --> 07:15.270
Each host is going to have at least one disk group and the disk group has to be made up of somewhere

07:15.270 --> 07:24.350
between 1 and seven hard disk drives and one flash disk the flash disk is going to be our read cache.

07:24.360 --> 07:29.310
It's going to be our right buffer every disk group needs one.

07:29.310 --> 07:34.030
So what I can do is I can actually take this in the lab environment.

07:34.170 --> 07:39.290
To be honest with you I don't actually have any flash storage capacity in my lab environment.

07:39.360 --> 07:46.080
What I've done is I've actually gone in here and manually kind of overridden this and marked these drives

07:46.080 --> 07:52.620
as flash even though they're not actually flash it's just a way for me to simulate having flash storage

07:53.010 --> 07:55.990
in a non-Flash storage environment.

07:56.400 --> 08:05.270
So anyways now I've got on each host two hard disk drives one flash drive and all three of my hosts

08:05.270 --> 08:07.820
should look identical they do.

08:07.820 --> 08:16.520
So now I get to pick and choose which disks do I actually want to claim for virtual San which disks

08:17.270 --> 08:24.560
are going to be part of my capacity here which discs are going to be part of my cash here.

08:24.620 --> 08:29.840
And you'll notice that the only ones that can be the cash here are the flash devices.

08:29.840 --> 08:36.500
So on each host I'm going to go ahead and identify this what we're doing here is something called Manual

08:36.540 --> 08:37.600
clay mode.

08:37.940 --> 08:44.600
So I'm going in and I'm individually specifying what each discs should be used for and if there are

08:44.600 --> 08:49.810
other discs that should not be dedicated to vse and I just won't utilize those disks.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.430
OK.

08:50.540 --> 08:56.740
So for each of these hosts Now I have two hard disk drives that are in the capacity tier.

08:56.900 --> 09:00.170
I have one flash disk that is in the cache tier.

09:00.230 --> 09:07.640
I'm going to go ahead and hit next and finish and it's going to tell me OK here's your total raw physical

09:07.640 --> 09:11.340
storage capacity 60 gigs.

09:11.430 --> 09:14.880
I have a total of 6 10 gig desks.

09:14.940 --> 09:23.550
That is my raw storage capacity my total VCR data store cash is 30 gigs I got 30 gigs of cash available

09:24.210 --> 09:27.810
and I have now created a Wii sand closter.

09:27.840 --> 09:35.130
So what this Wii San Kloster is going to do is it is going to take all of the capacity of those hard

09:35.130 --> 09:43.320
disks and kind of combine them together and create this one big data store that is shared by all of

09:43.320 --> 09:47.090
my ESX hosts that are part of that vse and cluster.

09:47.190 --> 09:52.830
They can all leverage that combined storage capacity of all of those hard disks.

09:53.270 --> 09:58.420
And as you can see here we've got manual clay mode I didn't enable the duplication or compression.

09:58.440 --> 10:07.170
I cannot enable those because this is a hybrid vs hand configuration using both Flash and traditional

10:07.170 --> 10:10.190
magnetic disks.

10:10.530 --> 10:16.920
I can manage my disks here if I want to I can evacuate data from a disk I can get everything off of

10:16.920 --> 10:19.240
a disk and replace it if I need to.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.620
That's where I'm going to do all of this sort of stuff is in disk management.

10:22.680 --> 10:28.380
And like I said I'm coming up with a VPN course so if you want to see some more of these specific operations

10:28.440 --> 10:32.530
check that out you can configure things like file domains.

10:32.530 --> 10:36.080
We're not really going to get into all of that here at this point.

10:36.090 --> 10:39.990
What I do want to show you is two more quick things.

10:39.990 --> 10:46.780
Number one we can see RV Ceann health here at the summary screen for the cluster.

10:46.800 --> 10:53.250
So if I expand that I can get a good idea of what's going on and my visa and cluster and I've got some

10:53.250 --> 10:58.620
kind of warning here so I could I could check that out and you can see some of these issues that are

10:58.620 --> 10:59.340
up here right.

10:59.340 --> 11:03.510
We've got performance dynast we've got a time synchronization problem.

11:03.630 --> 11:09.400
So we've got some issues with our San cluster we can look at VCM performance here as well.

11:09.450 --> 11:14.810
And at this point the performance services disabled you have to manually enable that.

11:15.120 --> 11:21.660
The other thing that I did want to quickly show you here is under monitor we've got a few issues triggered

11:22.080 --> 11:26.880
that are related to the san right now and we can also go under monitor we can see the health of our

11:26.880 --> 11:32.090
cluster so we can relatively easily dig into these health issues right here.

11:32.180 --> 11:35.960
And I've got a time synchronization problem that we need to resolve.

11:36.120 --> 11:40.220
I've got a hardware compatibility issue that I need to resolve.

11:40.440 --> 11:46.690
And so like I said I'm kind of a I'm kind of shoes stringing this thing together inside of a lab environment.

11:46.710 --> 11:50.650
So it's not exactly the ideal Visi an environment.

11:50.730 --> 11:52.660
But here's what I really want to show you.

11:52.660 --> 11:53.730
Capacity.

11:53.830 --> 12:00.340
This is going to show me exactly how much storage capacity I have available within my data store.

12:02.100 --> 12:07.860
So in this case I can see hey here's the size of my data store at 60 gigs of raw storage.

12:07.860 --> 12:15.660
Now as I start mirroring data I'm not actually going to have 60 gigs of usable space much like a RAID

12:15.660 --> 12:16.410
array.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.900
The sand sort of works the same way.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.950
I've got a mirror data in order to maintain reliability.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.830
So you see 60 gigs of usable space here.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.480
That's not what you're actually going to get.

12:28.590 --> 12:36.930
You're going to probably get somewhere closer to 30 gigs or maybe even less depending on how careful

12:36.930 --> 12:41.330
you are about preserving your data in the event of a failure.

12:41.370 --> 12:46.920
So that's as far as we are going to delve into Virtual SAN right now the things that you really need

12:46.920 --> 12:48.310
to remember for the exam.

12:48.540 --> 12:57.030
You can utilize the local capacity of many hosts to form a V San data store and it essentially combines

12:57.030 --> 13:03.420
their usable space to create this one big share data store that they all have available on each of our

13:03.420 --> 13:04.510
hosts.

13:04.590 --> 13:07.040
We are going to have disk groups.

13:07.140 --> 13:13.890
So let's actually go back to the cluster here and under monitor V San physical disks we can see a disk

13:13.890 --> 13:16.220
group for host 103.

13:16.290 --> 13:22.610
We can see another disk group for a host 104 and we can see another descript for host 100.

13:22.740 --> 13:26.380
Those disk groups are going to exist on my ESX my hosts.

13:26.550 --> 13:31.210
And those are going to represent the storage capacity that is available the VSE.

13:31.680 --> 13:38.500
We also saw that we had to create a VM kernel port on each host tagged for Virtual SAN traffic.

13:38.550 --> 13:44.340
That's how virtual machines read data stored in VSE and that is actually physically located on other

13:44.340 --> 13:45.320
hosts.

13:45.840 --> 13:50.250
And so those are some of the key concepts that you want to bear in mind as you prep for the exam.

13:50.400 --> 13:58.020
One final note there is both a hybrid the sand configuration and an all flash hand configuration with

13:58.020 --> 13:59.590
hybrid.

13:59.680 --> 14:07.410
You have a mixture of flash and magnetic desk's with an all flash configuration.

14:07.430 --> 14:15.390
It is 100 percent Flash and that gives us the ability to configure all sorts of other features on VCM

14:15.410 --> 14:23.960
as well things like duplication things like compression things like rate raid five rates sex.

14:24.080 --> 14:30.500
It gives us the ability to implement other space saving mechanisms in order to reduce some of the costs

14:30.500 --> 14:32.680
of that off flash storage.

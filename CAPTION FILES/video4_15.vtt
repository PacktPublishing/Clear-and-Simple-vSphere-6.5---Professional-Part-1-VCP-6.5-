00:01.230 --> 00:07.160
In this video I'll demonstrate how to configure a storage array type plug ins and path selection plug

00:07.160 --> 00:10.360
ins for an ESX host.

00:10.590 --> 00:16.530
So here you can see I am at the storage view of the Vee's for a web client and I've clicked on a particular

00:16.530 --> 00:23.120
data store and under that data store I've clicked on configure and connectivity and multipath.

00:23.990 --> 00:30.260
And here you can see this particular data store is mounted to one specific ESX host.

00:30.260 --> 00:36.050
This is actually a local data store on that particular ESX host.

00:36.270 --> 00:41.870
Down here we can see the different multipath details specific to this particular host.

00:41.910 --> 00:43.530
And this data store.

00:43.620 --> 00:49.440
So I can see here the path selection policy that is currently selected is one called fixed and then

00:49.440 --> 00:55.080
it has a little VM where in parentheses and I can see the preferred path.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.150
Now again this is a local data store.

00:57.180 --> 00:59.910
There's not a whole lot of paths to choose from here.

01:00.210 --> 01:08.840
And that I can see my storage array type policy which is v M.W. SATB local and if I click on edit multipath

01:08.850 --> 01:15.780
thing you can see here I can choose different path selection policies if I want.

01:16.080 --> 01:22.610
So number one I want to break down really quickly what the difference between these three policies are.

01:22.710 --> 01:30.320
Number one fixed basically means you have the ability to select a preferred path.

01:30.480 --> 01:37.140
If there are five different paths that this host can use to get to this storage you choose which one

01:37.140 --> 01:37.730
you want.

01:37.890 --> 01:46.340
You said that preferred path and that path is always used unless it fails at which point one of the

01:46.430 --> 01:48.610
other paths will be utilized.

01:48.950 --> 01:50.440
That's how fixed works.

01:52.250 --> 02:00.890
Most recently used is basically going to take the first path that becomes available and it will continuously

02:00.890 --> 02:05.360
use only that one path to reach this storage device.

02:06.190 --> 02:10.540
Now if that path fails it'll fail to a different path.

02:10.780 --> 02:15.120
And most recently used there is no way to set a preferred path.

02:15.730 --> 02:21.100
So if it fails to a different path it's going to always stay on that path unless that path fails.

02:21.340 --> 02:24.640
There's no fail back.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.450
And then finally we've got round robin.

02:26.620 --> 02:33.520
So if you have multiple paths to your storage device round robin will distribute that storage traffic

02:33.910 --> 02:36.590
across those different paths.

02:36.820 --> 02:39.120
So which one should you use.

02:39.460 --> 02:45.820
Well the real recommendation here is check with your storage vendors documentation use whatever your

02:45.820 --> 02:47.620
storage vendor recommends.

02:47.620 --> 02:55.210
If it's a local storage fixt is perfectly fine but your storage vendor may have a specific preference

02:55.510 --> 03:00.170
as to which of these path selection policies you utilize.

03:01.310 --> 03:07.100
Your storage vendor might even have their own plugins that they want you to implement.

03:07.160 --> 03:14.890
So you can see what we're using here is the NAACP the native multipath plug in this is built into every

03:14.890 --> 03:15.980
ESX I host.

03:16.090 --> 03:25.510
It just comes with ESX I'm the MP so fixed round robin most recently used those are Baig to write into

03:25.540 --> 03:26.550
ESX.

03:26.890 --> 03:35.560
Now those storage paths selection plugins may not really be the exact right ones for your particular

03:35.560 --> 03:36.400
storage vendor.

03:36.400 --> 03:42.910
Maybe they've made their own little load bouncing and failure detection mechanisms that are going to

03:42.910 --> 03:47.560
work much more efficiently with their particular brand of storage.

03:47.950 --> 03:52.220
That's what the pluggable storage architecture is all about.

03:52.240 --> 03:59.550
It gives you the ability to import multipath policies that have been provided by your storage vendor

04:00.680 --> 04:06.110
and the process is going to differ a little bit for each of the different storage vendors out there.

04:06.320 --> 04:13.790
So as far as what you need to know for the exam you need to be able to differentiate fixed in which

04:13.790 --> 04:20.630
case you set a preferred path and that preferred path is always used unless it fails most recently used

04:21.380 --> 04:23.620
in which case one path is used.

04:23.690 --> 04:26.450
If that path fails another path is used.

04:26.540 --> 04:28.100
There is no fail back.

04:28.150 --> 04:35.300
There is no preferred path and then round robin in which the traffic is distributed across multiple

04:35.300 --> 04:36.140
paths.

04:36.440 --> 04:41.690
You need to be able to differentiate between those three and you need to understand the concept that

04:41.690 --> 04:48.860
the native multi-pass thing plug in is built right into ESX high but that you can also implement pluggable

04:48.890 --> 04:54.230
storage architecture storage plug ins from your storage vendor.

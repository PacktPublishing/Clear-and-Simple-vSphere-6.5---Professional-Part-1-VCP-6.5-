00:00.980 --> 00:08.050
In this video I'll break down the differences between NFL version 3 and NTFS version 4 it out one.

00:08.430 --> 00:16.930
And as a Vee's fear of six FS version it out one is now supported for our NFL status stores.

00:16.960 --> 00:23.820
So NFL for now one comes with some additional functionality that version 3 does not include.

00:23.820 --> 00:29.970
That being said there are also some limitations that are specific to NFL version for not one that you

00:29.970 --> 00:31.490
need to be aware of as well.

00:31.520 --> 00:31.860
Right.

00:31.980 --> 00:40.260
So number one with end of US version 3 storage traffic is strictly unencrypted.

00:40.350 --> 00:40.700
Right.

00:40.710 --> 00:52.000
So we can only use FS on networks that we 100 percent trust the other limiting factor is as you can

00:52.000 --> 00:58.480
see here there is only one IP address on our network attached storage device.

00:58.550 --> 01:11.720
So because of that the ESX host uses only one TCAP connection for I O to the FS storage device only

01:11.720 --> 01:17.720
a single IP address can be used for the NFA server per data store and this can make the load balancing

01:17.720 --> 01:24.680
difficult because we typically use IP hash for load balancing this type of traffic.

01:25.010 --> 01:34.540
If we have the same IP for all of our traffic IP hashes Im going to do us any good.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.860
And the final limitation actually not really a limitation but more of our requirement is that with the

01:39.870 --> 01:46.240
edifies version 3 the ESX I host requires a root access to the server.

01:46.550 --> 01:51.710
And this can become a little bit of an issue because many N.F. fast devices come with something called

01:51.710 --> 02:00.040
the root squash enabled which basically disallows remote attempts to connect to it as root.

02:00.050 --> 02:08.390
So that's just something to bear in mind with version 3 is that the ESX host must have root level access

02:08.660 --> 02:10.480
to the FS server.

02:11.300 --> 02:16.670
Ok so fast forward to his version for not one and some things have changed.

02:16.940 --> 02:24.860
Number one there is improved security because the headers of all of our and FS traffic are encrypted

02:24.860 --> 02:25.800
and signed.

02:26.070 --> 02:30.760
And so we're not actually encrypting all of the storage traffic but we're encrypting all of the headers.

02:31.010 --> 02:33.100
So we have an improved level of security there.

02:33.440 --> 02:40.670
Also you'll notice a second IP address just appeared on my network attached storage device multipath

02:40.670 --> 02:44.900
thing is now supported using multiple IP addresses.

02:44.910 --> 02:53.760
And also we no longer need root level access with NFL version 4.1.

02:53.770 --> 02:59.120
The big downside to any of us version for that one is VHI is not supported.

02:59.200 --> 03:07.870
So if you're not familiar with VHI it's the VSD for API for Array integration and what it allows you

03:07.870 --> 03:12.600
to do is carry out certain vse Farrell type functions.

03:12.610 --> 03:15.470
NF has Version 3 right.

03:15.490 --> 03:20.860
Things like creating thick provisioned disks rely on VHI

03:23.960 --> 03:24.530
so.

03:24.910 --> 03:31.670
And as a result for not one we have Kerberos support included This is what actually removes the need

03:31.670 --> 03:33.310
for root level access.

03:33.380 --> 03:39.770
But what you need to do is make sure that all of your hosts use a matching set of credentials and to

03:39.770 --> 03:45.640
do this you'll utilize an active directory domain controller and key distribution center.

03:45.650 --> 03:54.360
One final item that I want to point out if you're currently using FS version 3 and you want to create

03:54.600 --> 04:01.930
or want to cut over two and it has a version for it out one you can not connect from one host using

04:02.010 --> 04:08.090
FS version 3 and another host using FS version for it out one to the same data store.

04:08.270 --> 04:14.530
As a matter of fact if you try to do that you can potentially corrupt the contents of that data store.

04:14.840 --> 04:22.040
So the best way to kind of make this transition to N.F. has for not one is to do it as a whole or you

04:22.040 --> 04:25.750
don't want half of your hosts on three and half of your hosts for not one.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.420
This is a this is kind of like a hard cut over.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.660
You want to get everything up to 4.1 simultaneously.

04:32.660 --> 04:36.650
That way there is no disparity between your ESX I hosts.

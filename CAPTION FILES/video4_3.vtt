00:00.810 --> 00:04.950
In this video I'll demonstrate how to create an NFL data store.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.970
So before we get started I want to show you some of the methodology that I'm using in my lab environment

00:10.060 --> 00:10.740
here.

00:10.990 --> 00:19.600
What I've actually done is gone ahead and created an NFL server on a Windows Server 2012 are two instance.

00:19.600 --> 00:26.910
And here you can see a little folder that I created and I'm simply sharing this folder out Viana FS.

00:27.010 --> 00:32.840
So I went ahead and installed this role on this particular Windows Server.

00:33.070 --> 00:39.040
And the reason I want to show you this before we get going is because of a few configuration things

00:39.040 --> 00:41.730
that you need to bear in mind.

00:41.740 --> 00:50.380
Right so I created a little folder called and afast Demel I in this case decided to do no server authentication.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.030
Now this depends are you doing.

00:52.030 --> 00:59.540
And if this version 3 or are you doing an offensive version for one if you're doing NFC version 3.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.010
It does not support Kerberos authentication.

01:03.010 --> 01:10.720
So in this case I have basically not required any kind of server authentication and other permissions

01:11.860 --> 01:19.960
what I could do is I could specifically add certain IP addresses that I want to allow to access this

01:20.050 --> 01:30.220
and FS storage so I could limit access to this data store by specifying certain IP addresses where you

01:30.220 --> 01:35.140
can see what I've done in this case is I've allowed all machines read write access.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.050
And I'm actually allowing root access as well.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.810
And that's another thing that's important.

01:39.970 --> 01:46.070
So with N.F. US version 3 you have to allow root access to the data store.

01:46.180 --> 01:49.240
So that has to actually be setup on my NFL server.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.510
Now all of this changes with NFC version four out one with FS 4.1.

01:53.590 --> 02:02.650
We can utilize Kerberos authentication to go ahead and allow access to that data store but I'm using

02:02.650 --> 02:04.340
NFC version 3 in this case.

02:04.390 --> 02:08.770
So I'm going to go ahead and launch my vees fair web client.

02:09.190 --> 02:15.070
And once I get logged in I'm going to pick one of my ESX hosts and I'm going to go to that particular

02:15.070 --> 02:22.960
host and create a new NFL data store and when I create that new data store what I'm essentially going

02:22.960 --> 02:30.100
to do is I am going to point to that folder that I just created on that Windows Server.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.760
That's how an NFL data store works right.

02:32.800 --> 02:40.090
My ESX host does not own the file system it does not manage the file system the file system is managed

02:40.090 --> 02:42.800
by that Windows Server that I just showed you.

02:42.820 --> 02:51.070
So what I am essentially doing with an NFL data store is I am granting access to a shared folder on

02:51.070 --> 02:52.300
some other server.

02:52.570 --> 02:57.850
So let's go to my first host here and under storage I'm going to click on datasource.

02:57.880 --> 03:03.050
We are at the configure tab and here we have the option to create a new data store.

03:03.430 --> 03:05.900
And so I'm going to click on NTFS.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.740
I'm going to choose FS version 3.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.450
I'm going to set my data source.

03:10.870 --> 03:15.490
I'm going to put in the folder that I created on my Windows Server and the IP address of the Windows

03:15.490 --> 03:16.960
server itself.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.770
And that's really it with of US version 3.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.800
These are very simple and easy to create.

03:22.840 --> 03:26.890
And so now let's take a look here's my new data store and.

03:27.940 --> 03:31.920
And my data store is an NFL version 3 data store.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.780
You can see here I've got a warning on the data store.

03:34.780 --> 03:39.790
Let's take a look at what that warning is it should be a space warning because there's really not very

03:39.790 --> 03:47.320
much space at all on that server to actually utilize HARRIS So Data Store usage on disk.

03:47.350 --> 03:49.220
Yup that's what the problem is.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.970
There's only four points one for gigs of space available.

03:53.350 --> 04:00.220
And the reason is because there's only 4.1 four gigs available on the actual Windows server itself.

04:00.220 --> 04:02.820
So that's what we're seeing here.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.720
The storage capacity.

04:04.720 --> 04:09.960
So anyways it's a relatively straightforward process to create an NFL data store.

04:10.090 --> 04:14.020
So here in the storage view we see the new data store that I've just created.

04:14.020 --> 04:21.280
And at the moment you can see it's only connected to one ESX host but I have multiple ESX I hosts that

04:21.310 --> 04:24.910
could potentially also utilize that data store.

04:24.910 --> 04:30.340
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the storage view.

04:30.340 --> 04:35.800
I'm going to Right-Click that data store and I'm going to choose to mount the data store two additional

04:35.800 --> 04:43.570
hosts and and pick the other hosts that should also have access to that data store and go ahead and

04:43.570 --> 04:46.360
mounted to these other data stores.

04:46.630 --> 04:54.310
So that way we can access this data store on multiple ESX hosts not just the one ESX host that are used

04:54.310 --> 04:56.840
to create it and there we go.

04:56.890 --> 04:57.990
It looks like it worked.

04:57.990 --> 05:07.030
So if I go to this second ESX host I now see the NFL demo data store available here as well.

05:07.090 --> 05:12.670
And then finally the last thing I want to show you if we go to our data store under the storage view

05:13.120 --> 05:19.340
we can also choose to unmount this data store and I can pick which hosts I'm going to unmount it from.

05:19.390 --> 05:27.190
Now the main thing to bear in mind here is that when you unmount a NFC data store you're not actually

05:27.190 --> 05:32.760
deleting any of the data contained in that data store remember.

05:32.920 --> 05:42.670
In this case my NFA server is on a Windows Server 2012 virtual machine Well I don't own that file system.

05:42.660 --> 05:46.090
My ESX I host do not own that file system.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.270
They cannot destroy that folder.

05:49.270 --> 05:56.770
So if I go hadn't unmount the data store what I'm essentially saying is that my ESX I hosts no longer

05:56.770 --> 06:04.360
need access to that particular data store but all the files and folders that exist in that folder are

06:04.360 --> 06:05.530
still going to be there.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.260
So I'm not actually destroying the data.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.910
I'm simply unmounting the data store from these ESX I hosts.

06:12.160 --> 06:17.890
And now you can see the data store is no longer available to them but any files that were created in

06:17.890 --> 06:20.130
that data store will still exist.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.420
They will not be destroyed when it unmounting.

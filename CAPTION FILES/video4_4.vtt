00:00.860 --> 00:07.050
In this video we'll take a look at I because the storage concepts and we'll learn how I suppose storage

00:07.050 --> 00:12.240
solutions can be used to deliver VMI fast data stores.

00:12.280 --> 00:16.480
So here we see the different components of an ice Gazi storage array.

00:16.540 --> 00:23.320
And I suppose he is really just one of the many options of storage arrays that we have available.

00:23.350 --> 00:30.100
We could do a fiber channel storage array or we could do and eFax or Fiber Channel over ethernet but

00:30.100 --> 00:36.310
for the moment let's just focus in on ice scuzzy specifically And let's take a look at the components

00:36.340 --> 00:38.370
of the storage array itself.

00:38.470 --> 00:45.490
And so let's get rid of the VSE fair side of our picture here and focus specifically on the network

00:46.120 --> 00:47.420
and the array components.

00:47.470 --> 00:47.920
Right.

00:48.010 --> 00:55.150
So here we see connecting to the storage array We've got anything to switch right and that's the type

00:55.150 --> 01:00.600
of network that we use for eyes because he is just a standard Ethernet network.

01:00.910 --> 01:07.330
So we've got this ethernet network connectivity here that we use to connect our ESX hosts to the storage

01:07.330 --> 01:07.880
array.

01:08.380 --> 01:16.290
And those ethernet switches connect to something called Storage processors on the storage array.

01:17.840 --> 01:23.310
And the storage processors are really the brains of the operation for the ice because the storage array

01:23.890 --> 01:29.220
right they provide processing horsepower as well as connectivity.

01:29.340 --> 01:35.700
That's how the I suppose the storage array connects to that either network.

01:35.770 --> 01:40.870
And then of course within the ice Cozi storage array you know we've got storage right we've got disk

01:40.870 --> 01:41.630
space.

01:41.890 --> 01:43.960
So here we see our disk aggregate.

01:44.110 --> 01:50.590
These are essentially just think of it as a shelf of physical desks and that's all of the disk space

01:50.590 --> 01:53.790
that we have available within that storage array.

01:54.790 --> 02:01.720
And if we want to take all of that aggregated disk space and carve it up into smaller chunks.

02:01.900 --> 02:05.910
That's the purpose of a logical unit number or lun.

02:06.050 --> 02:14.620
All right so Lund's are used to simply divide up that big aggregate of storage space into smaller chunks

02:14.740 --> 02:15.780
called Lunts.

02:16.030 --> 02:22.080
And that's what we're really going to utilize to create our VM EF-S data stores.

02:22.110 --> 02:28.440
So if we go back here a little bit in our slide and we take a look at the ESX host what we're eventually

02:28.440 --> 02:32.810
going to accomplish here through a variety of different options.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.710
Look at the different ways like software I because your hardware I scuzzy But what we want to accomplish

02:38.800 --> 02:47.250
is we want to allow the ESX I host to get visibility to these Lunds we want to allow the ESX host to

02:47.250 --> 02:53.320
know that those loans exist and to be able to create VM fast data stores on them.

02:53.380 --> 02:53.960
Right.

02:54.060 --> 02:57.120
So the network is really just a means to an end.

02:57.160 --> 02:57.440
Right.

02:57.450 --> 03:05.640
And in this way I suppose the fiber channel fiber channel over ether net they're all very similar.

03:05.880 --> 03:11.430
They just have different networks but they're essentially delivering the same service and that service

03:11.430 --> 03:19.710
is storage space in the form of ones that can be formatted with the VM afast file system and use to

03:19.710 --> 03:21.390
store virtual machine files.

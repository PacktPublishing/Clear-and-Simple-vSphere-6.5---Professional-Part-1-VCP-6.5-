In this video I'll demonstrate how to create a software.

00:05.130 --> 00:12.080
I scuzz the initiator connection from your ESX host to a storage array.

00:12.180 --> 00:19.770
So here we can see if we look at my ESX I host it we're looking at my host and we've clicked on configure

00:20.160 --> 00:27.720
and storage adapters you can see a number of storage adapters here one of which is the eye scuzzy software

00:27.960 --> 00:29.300
adapter.

00:29.310 --> 00:34.650
If you don't have one of these on your host Currently you can just click this little green plus button

00:35.160 --> 00:36.720
and it's greyed out for me.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.660
That's because I've already created it.

00:38.700 --> 00:44.910
Basically you just had that plus button and cradle software ice Kaze adapter and this will appear right.

00:45.060 --> 00:48.420
Initially it's not really providing you with anything.

00:48.540 --> 00:52.020
Right we can see we've got a software adapter here.

00:52.020 --> 00:54.360
There are no devices listed them right.

00:54.380 --> 00:54.840
So.

00:54.840 --> 01:02.940
So the goal here is to connect to an ICE Gazi storage device and to see a list of Lund's presented here

01:02.940 --> 01:04.510
on this device list.

01:04.830 --> 01:09.520
And we can then use those Lund's to create data stores.

01:10.080 --> 01:15.210
So in order to do that I need to configure a dynamic discovery.

01:15.210 --> 01:22.320
I need to set up my host and tell it some information about the storage array so that it can query the

01:22.320 --> 01:23.180
storage array.

01:23.190 --> 01:25.020
So that's what I'm going to do right now.

01:25.140 --> 01:31.200
I'm going to put in the IP address of my eyes because the storage device and I'm going to go ahead and

01:31.200 --> 01:38.190
hit OK here and what it's going to tell me is that now a rescan of this storage adapter is recommended.

01:38.210 --> 01:45.830
Right now I've just created a new storage adapter so it wants to do a rescan and what a rescanned is

01:45.860 --> 01:54.320
basically it's your host reaching out to the storage array and finding out which ones are available.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.620
All right so let's go ahead and do that.

01:56.650 --> 02:03.400
Let's hit this button right here we're going to run a rescan and hopefully we'll see some Lund's appear

02:03.850 --> 02:05.280
down in this device's area.

02:05.440 --> 02:06.510
And there they are.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.350
Right so now we've got Lund's available.

02:09.510 --> 02:20.040
So just to kind of reiterate real quickly here we created a software I scuzzy storage adapter we configured

02:20.040 --> 02:29.280
in with dynamic discovery and dynamic discovery allows my ESX host to reach out to this storage array

02:29.700 --> 02:37.340
and query it and when it does querido after we perform a rescan the storage rate will return a list

02:37.340 --> 02:40.040
of all of the loans that has available.

02:40.040 --> 02:46.900
We can now utilize these the ones to create a data store and that's going to be the next step in our

02:46.900 --> 02:50.020
process here is to go ahead and create a VM EF-S data store.

WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:05.180
In this video I'll demonstrate how to create a vm a fast data store.

00:05.490 --> 00:12.870
So here I am in the Vee's for a web client and in my last video I actually created a software ice Gazi

00:12.930 --> 00:16.990
initiator for this particular ESX I host.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.790
So here's my software because the initiator.

00:19.900 --> 00:24.190
And through this software I suppose the initiator.

00:24.190 --> 00:31.150
I have a line that's available and having a LUN is the key starting point if I'm going to create a data

00:31.150 --> 00:33.640
store on VM FS I need that one.

00:34.210 --> 00:37.200
So I'm going to go ahead and click on datasource here.

00:38.190 --> 00:43.170
And I'm going to click on the little plus icon to create myself a new VM a fast data store.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.120
And at this point I'll name the data store.

00:45.270 --> 00:46.940
I'll just call it VM FSMO.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.780
And what I'm doing is I'm choosing a lane.

00:50.010 --> 00:57.450
So a lawn is just this big chunk of raw unformatted disk space that is available on my eyes because

00:57.450 --> 01:05.610
the storage array and my host can communicate with that nice cosy storage array using the ice Gazi software

01:05.610 --> 01:08.540
initiator that I created in the last video.

01:10.210 --> 01:13.480
Now I will choose the VM FS version.

01:13.480 --> 01:22.600
So if all of my hosts are going to be ESX I 6.5 I'm just going to go ahead and go with VM FSX if I still

01:22.600 --> 01:30.250
have some ESX size 6 or even older versions of VSX I hosts then I'll go with the IMF has five.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.510
All of my hosts are 6 5.

01:32.560 --> 01:38.720
I'm going to go with VM FSX and what I'm going to say is OK on this particular line.

01:39.010 --> 01:44.440
Do we want to use all of the space available on that line or do I want to say hey I'm just going to

01:44.440 --> 01:49.490
create a data store that is 15 gigs or something smaller.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.800
I'm just going to use all of the space on that particular line.

01:53.570 --> 01:59.840
And that I'm going to go ahead and hit Next here and what's going to actually happen in this scenario

02:00.500 --> 02:03.370
is a new data store is going to be created.

02:04.450 --> 02:12.980
That space that line is going to be formatted with the VM FS file system.

02:13.010 --> 02:19.800
So now I've got this VM half as demo data store available to this particular ESX I host.

02:19.850 --> 02:24.140
I've got a bunch of space available on it and I can start to create virtual machines and store them

02:24.140 --> 02:25.510
on that data store.

02:25.580 --> 02:32.000
Now here's the million dollar question I've created this data store and I did everything on this particular

02:32.000 --> 02:33.570
ESX host here.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.360
What about this host.

02:35.540 --> 02:40.590
We need shared storage for things like Wii motion Well look at that.

02:40.820 --> 02:41.910
Isn't that magic.

02:42.860 --> 02:48.740
The data store just simply appeared on this other ESX host.

02:48.780 --> 02:50.060
How is that possible.

02:50.160 --> 03:00.950
Well the other ESX host also is configured with a software I scuzzy adapter and that other software

03:00.960 --> 03:06.890
I scuzzy adapter is also configured to query the same storage array.

03:07.050 --> 03:13.080
So every so often it's going to do its own little rescan and it's going to detect any new BMF has volumes

03:13.590 --> 03:18.690
and they're going to just be available to this particular host.

03:18.700 --> 03:26.170
Now I have some options I can do things like masking if I don't want to make a particular datastore

03:26.320 --> 03:31.510
available to every host I can go into my storage system and control that.

03:31.510 --> 03:37.320
But I just wanted to show you that by default both hosts are connected to that storage array.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.600
Both hosts get access to that data store.

03:39.610 --> 03:43.550
I don't have to go to each individual host and mount that data store.

03:43.900 --> 03:49.330
If I'm done with my data store what I'll do is all right click it and I can choose to number one either

03:49.360 --> 03:50.430
unmount.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.130
So I'm going to go ahead and unmount this particular data store.

03:53.200 --> 03:58.840
And what you're doing when you unmount data stores you're saying something like hey from this particular

03:58.840 --> 04:04.220
host I do not need access to that data store and that's going to say OK.

04:04.630 --> 04:11.970
So if I refresh here now this host no longer is going to have access to the VMA fast demo data store

04:12.400 --> 04:16.040
and you can see here that the volume is now unmounted.

04:16.150 --> 04:19.020
So this particular host no longer has access to it.

04:19.390 --> 04:24.100
This host still does.

04:24.160 --> 04:29.530
Now the other thing that I could do is I code right click that data store and I could actually delete

04:29.590 --> 04:30.900
the data store.

04:31.090 --> 04:38.140
What you need to be aware of in this case is any data that is on that data store is going to be permanently

04:38.150 --> 04:39.210
deleted.

04:39.550 --> 04:43.550
All the data on that data source is going to be gone when I delete that data store.

04:44.600 --> 04:49.670
So if I choose to delete a data store I am permanently destroying that data store and all of the data

04:50.030 --> 04:51.990
that is contained within it.

04:52.220 --> 04:53.720
And now the data store is gone.

04:53.730 --> 04:58.290
If I go back to this other host that is or should be gone there as well.

04:58.350 --> 05:00.800
So that's how we create a vm a fast data store.

05:00.840 --> 05:06.240
What you're essentially doing is you are taking a LUN that's being presented by some kind of storage

05:06.240 --> 05:14.110
system formatting it with the VM FS file system and making it available to your ESX hosts.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.600
So that virtual machine files can be stored on it.

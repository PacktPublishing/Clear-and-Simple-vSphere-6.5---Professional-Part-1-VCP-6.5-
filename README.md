## About the Video Course
VMware vSphere is everywhere. Non-virtualized datacenters are a thing of the past, and in order to stay relevant you must understand vSphere. This course builds off my Clear and Simple vSphere 6.5 Foundations videos, and gives you a deeper understanding of vSphere. You will learn about vSphere concepts such as vSphere Networking (including a deep look at Distributed Switches), Storage (including VSAN, vVOLs, and much more), and vSphere Security. This course provides many live demos of many common tasks that you may need to perform as a vSphere administrator using the vSphere web client.
